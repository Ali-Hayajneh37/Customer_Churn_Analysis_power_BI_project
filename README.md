Project Description: Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn patterns to identify key factors influencing retention and attrition. Using a dataset of 6,687 customers, including 1,796 churned users (~26.86% churn rate), the analysis examines demographic, usage, and subscription factors.

Key insights include churn distribution by state, service plans (e.g., international plans), and customer behavior trends. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to reduce churn, enhance customer experience, and improve retention strategies
